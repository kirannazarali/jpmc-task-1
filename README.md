# JPMC Task 1
Starter repo for task 1 of the JPMC software engineering program

Purpose of Task 1: Monitor 2 highly correlated stocks and determine when correlation weakens. This is beneficial because, when the correlation weakens, a potential trade strategy is to buy the underperforming stock and sell the overperforming stock (assuming both stock prices converge).
